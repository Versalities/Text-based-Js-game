# Text-based-Js-game
A text based, somewhat-interactive casual story, built (more accuratly, is building on as of now) on JS.

Trying my hand in some artistic creation. Having lots of fun, but my head hurts from the oversized code which, i suspect,
totaly not dry at all :-D But whatever, i'll sharpen it later, right now i just need this game to work.

Version 0.1 - 31.08.2016.
Character creation and 1st event are completed. Need some additional styling at the very least though, but anyway,this content is operational.
